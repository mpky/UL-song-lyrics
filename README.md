#### UL Attempting to Predict Genre from Song Lyrics


For this project I applied various natural language processing techniques to a corpus of song lyrics. The first section of this project used unsupervised models to cluster each song to see if I could derive any underlying patterns to the lyrics. The second section employed supervised models to determine to what extent the models are able to predict a song's genre from its lyrics.

Were I able to produce a consistent, working model, there are ample use-cases for applying that model to the lyrics of a new song. As shown below, labeling each artist's genre by hand is very tedious, so automating that would save a lot of time and effort.
